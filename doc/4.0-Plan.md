# CS 1440 Assignment 4.0: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.0-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

* In this assignment I am to search through the source code and identify "code smells." These are things in the code that are red flags for error prone code structures and code that makes it difficult to read and eddit. After we Identify them we are to refactor the code so that it will not only function propperly, but will be easy to read and add new features to. 
* A good solution will be easy to read, and will perform all functions properly while allowing room for new features to be added. 
* the good thing is that I know how to do this assignment since it feels much more like rewriting a papper after identifying fallacies rather than making something out of scratch. However, that means the things that come up that I won't know how to do are unknown unknowns. 


## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.0-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

* First thing I gotta do is delete the unused import statements.

### main.py

keep the used import statements
I asked chat gpt to simplify the main module. and this is what it gave me (comments are made by me not chatgpt). 
* list of changes:
    * Removed redundant imports.
    * Combined the lists of Mandelbrot and Phoenix fractals into a single list for simplicity.
    * Simplified the command-line argument check and printing available choices.
    * Removed unnecessary loops and simplified the fractal selection logic.
    * Used more descriptive variable names where necessary.
    * Removed unused variables and unreachable code.
    * Used formatted strings for better readability.

If combining the list turns out to be a mistake I can just undo that change. 
```
MBROTS = [elephants,
          leaf, 
          mandelbrot, 
          mandelbrot-zoomed, 
          seahorse, 
          spiral0, 
          spiral1, 
          starfish,
          squid]

PHOENIX = list(phoenix_fractals.keys())

fractal_names = PHOENIX + MBROTS

if len(sys.argv) < 2 or sys.argv[1] not in fractal_names
    print("Please provide a valid fractal name as an argument. Choices are:")
    for name in fractal_names:
        print(f"\t{name}")
    sys.exit(1)

fractal = sys.argv[1]

if fractal in PHOENIX:
    phoenix_fractals(fractal)
else:
    mbrot_main(fractal)
```

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.0-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.0-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.0-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.0-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
