# Fractal Visualizer User Manual

*   **How to run**: From the cs1440-assn4/ directory give the python command with the src/ directory and the main.py file name. Then add a space and type the name of the fractal you want to create. The fractal names are as follows:
    * mandelbrot
    * mandelbrot-zoomed
    * leaf
    * elephants
    * spiral0
    * spiral1
    * starfish
    * phoenix
    * peacock
    * monkey-knife-fight
    * shrimp-cocktail
    * seahorse
* if you call the function without specifying what fractal you want to make it will print a list of available fractals just like the one above. 
* This program when run will produce a photo in a seperate window. As soon as it is finished running it will save the fractal as a png file in the src/ directory. 
Enjoy!
