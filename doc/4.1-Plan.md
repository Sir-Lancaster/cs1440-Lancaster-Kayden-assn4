# CS 1440 Assignment 4.1: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
*   [ ] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

* The Goal of this assignment is to change the fractal-painter program into an object oriented program such that it will be able to easily implement new fractals, and will be more easily updateable. 
* To have a *good* solution to this problem, it will need to follow good organizational patterns of object oriented programming, not implement anything that overcomplecates anything, assume nothing about file locations, create new-well organized-classes and modules. 
* The biggest challenge I forsee is creating the pallete class because reading the Requirements.md file made it clear that there are some things about it that I do not know how to do, I'll probably have to have chatGPT explain the concepts to me after I do some research into it. 
* The Data used by the program is a large list of fractal configurations contained in the data/ folder. They will be accessed by a method that I will write called fractalConfig(?) which will take the data and store it in a dictionary for the two factory classes to use. 
* The output, like the last assignment, will be in the form of a tkinter window of the image of the fractal. 

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

I am going to brute force main.py ...
### Pallete Class:
    I used chat GPT to teach me about the Colour module and had it help me conceptualize the two designs. After I get the other ones done This will undoubtably not be the final design. 
    ```
    class Pallete
        def init()
            -- do something --
        def getColor()
            raise NotImplementedError("Concrete subclass of Palette must implement getColor() method")  # copied from 4.1 Requirements
    
    class StripedPalette(Palette):
        def getColor(self, n):
            # Create a color palette with repeating stripes
            colors = ['#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF']
            return colors[n % len(colors)]

    class GradientPalette(Palette):
        def __init__(self, start_color, end_color):
            super().__init__()
            self.start_color = Color(start_color)
            self.end_color = Color(end_color)

        def getColor(self, n)
            # Create a color palette using a gradient between start and end colors
            interpolation = n / 512.0  # Adjust for the desired number of iterations
            color = self.start_color.range_to(self.end_color, interpolation)
            return color.get_hex_l()

    class DynamicPalette(Palette)
        def __init__(self, start_color, end_color)
            super().init()
            self.start_color = Color(start_color)
            self.end_color = Color(end_color)

        def getColor(self, n)
            # Create a dynamically generated color palette using the colour module
            interpolation = n / 512.0
            color = self.start_color.range_to(self.end_color, interpolation)
            return color.get_hex_l()
    ```

### Palette Factory
```
import Palette 

class PaletteFactory:
    def makePalette(palette_name is dynamic by default) 
        Palette_Options = Palette()

        if palette_name == "striped"
            return Palette_options.StripedPalette()
        elif palette_name == "gradient":
            return Palette_options.GradientPalette("#FF0000", "#0000FF")
        elif palette_name == "dynamic":
            return Palette_options.DynamicPalette("#FF0000", "#00FF00")
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Invalid palette requested")
```

### Image painter
I think this will work, We'll see during phase 2 I suppose.

```
# ImagePainter.py

from tkinter import Tk, Canvas, PhotoImage, mainloop
import time
import sys

class ImagePainter:
    def __init__(self, fractal, name, count, palette)       
        self.fractal = fractal
        self.name = name
        self.count = count
        self.palette = palette
```
the initializer will take the info from the factories and such, then it assigns them to variables to be used by the rest of the class. Then it is a matter of adding the new variables to the previouse functions like so:

```
    def statusbar(self, rows, cols):
        portion = (IMAGE_SIZE - rows) / IMAGE_SIZE
        pixels = (IMAGE_SIZE - rows) * IMAGE_SIZE
        status_percent = '{:>4.0%}'.format(portion)
        status_bar = '=' * int(STATUS_BAR_WIDTH * portion)
        status_bar = '{:<33}'.format(status_bar)
        return ''.join(list(['[', status_percent, ' ', status_bar, ']']))

    def paint(self):
        print(f"Rendering {self.name} fractal")
        # Note the time of when we started so we can measure performance improvements
        before = time.time()

        # Set up the GUI so that we can display the fractal image on the screen
        win = Tk()
        img = PhotoImage(width=IMAGE_SIZE, height=IMAGE_SIZE)
        canvas = Canvas(win, width=IMAGE_SIZE, height=IMAGE_SIZE, bg='#000000')
        canvas.create_image((IMAGE_SIZE / 2.0, IMAGE_SIZE / 2.0), image=img, state="normal")
        canvas.pack()

        minx = self.fractal['centerX'] - (self.fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
        maxx = self.fractal['centerX'] + (self.fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
        miny = self.fractal['centerY'] - (self.fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)

        # At this scale, how much length and height on the
        # imaginary plane does one pixel take?
        pixelsize = abs(maxx - minx) / IMAGE_SIZE

        max_iter = len(self.palette)
        for row in range(IMAGE_SIZE, 0, -1):
            cc = []
            for col in range(IMAGE_SIZE):
                x = minx + col * pixelsize
                y = miny + row * pixelsize
                cc.append(self.palette[self.count(complex(x, y), max_iter - 1)])
            img.put('{' + ' '.join(cc) + '}', to=(0, IMAGE_SIZE - row))
            win.update()  # display a row of pixels
            print(self.statusbar(row, col), end='\r', file=sys.stderr)  # the '\r' returns the cursor to the leftmost column

        after = time.time()
        print(f"\nDone in {after - before:.3f} seconds!", file=sys.stderr)
        img.write(f"{self.name}.png")
        print(f"Wrote picture {self.name}.png", file=sys.stderr)

        print("Close the image window to exit the program", file=sys.stderr)

        # tkinter.mainloop keeps GUI open
        mainloop()

```
### Fractal Class
The parent abstract class is pretty much exactly like the palette class, the four subclasses are what is different.
```
    class Fractal
        def init()
            -- do something --
        def getColor()
            raise NotImplementedError("Concrete subclass of Palette must implement getColor() method")  # copied from 4.1 Requirements
    
    class Mandelbrot(Fractal)
    def count(self, c)
        z = 0
        max_iterations = 1000, You can adjust this value
        for i in range(max_iterations):
            z = z * z + c
            if abs(z) > 2.0:
                return i
        return max_iterations

    class Phoenix(Fractal)
        def count(self, c)
            z = 0
            max_iterations = 1000
            for i in range(max_iterations):
                z = z * z + c.conjugate()
                if abs(z) > 2.0:
                    return i
            return max_iterations

    class NightmareFractal(Fractal):
        def count(self, c):
            # Your custom fractal formula implementation
            z = 0
            max_iterations = 2000
            for i in range(max_iterations)
                z = z * x + c
                if abs(z) > 3.0
                    return i
            return max_iterations

    class TheBigCheese(Fractal):
        def count(self, c):
            # Another custom fractal formula implementation
            z = 0
            max iterations = 1500
            for i in range(max iterations)
                z = z * z + c
                if abs(z) > 2.5
                    return i
            return max iterations
```
these will probably be adjusted after I see how they do in the runtime.

### FractalFactory
    This will also be pretty much the same as the palette factory
    ```
    import Fractal

class FractalFactory:
    def makeFractal(Fractal_name is Mandelbrot by default) 
        Fractal_options = Fractal()

        if Fractal_name == "Mandelbrot"
            return Fractal_options.Mandelbrot()
        elif Fractal_name == "Phoenix":
            return Fractal_options.Phoenix()
        elif Fractal_name == "NigtmareFractal"
            return Fractal_options.NightmareFractal()
        elif Fractal_name == "TheBigCheese"
            return Fractal_options.TheBigCheese()
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Invalid Fractal requested")
    ```

### Fractal Parser
```
class FractalParser:
    def parseFracFile(file_path):
        # Dictionary to store the parsed parameters
        fractal_dict = {}

        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                for line in file:
                    # Strip whitespace and convert to lowercase
                    line = line.strip().lower()

                    # Skip comments and blank lines
                    if line.startswith('#') or not line:
                        continue

                    # Split the line into key and value
                    key, value = map(str.strip, line.split(':', 1))

                    # Store the key-value pair in the dictionary
                    fractal_dict[key] = value

        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Let open() fail if the file is missing
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"File '{file_path}' not found.")

        except Exception as e:
            # Handle other file reading or parsing errors
            raise RuntimeError(f"Error reading file '{file_path}': {str(e)}")

        return fractal_dict
```

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.

* While implementing palette classes i had not written the correct implementation of the colour module. Took me about an hour but i fixed it.
* While implementing the functions I had to change a few designs as things came up that I didn't think of. 
* Main was a bit of a pain to design but I GOT 'EM! sorta... well right now it just prints a colored square to the screen, but that is something I can fix in testing. 

## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.1-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-tested` and push it to GitLab.

### Image_Painter bugs
this block of code is giving me trouble:
```
        max_iter = len(self.palette)
        for row in range(IMAGE_SIZE, 0, -1):
            cc = []
            for col in range(IMAGE_SIZE):
                x = minx + col * pixelsize
                y = miny + row * pixelsize
                cc.append(self.palette[self.count(complex(x, y), max_iter - 1)])
```
it is trying to use self.count as a function when it is just an integer. I guess originally it must have used either mandelbrot.py or phoenix.py to get the count. Now I have to find a different way to append these for each coordinate. 
I was able to fix it, but it was caused by something i must have changed when I converted it to a class, so I will have to put it back into a class.
Put it back into a class, and now it is working!!!

found a bug where the image was being saved to data/fractal.frac.png the fix for this was to change the block of code at the end of image painter and change the img.write(self.name) to a temporary filename which stripped off the data/ and .frac part so that it would only write to fractal.png. 

## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
