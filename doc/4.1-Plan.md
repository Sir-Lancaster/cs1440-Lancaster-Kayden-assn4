# CS 1440 Assignment 4.1: Software Development Plan

## Phase 0: Requirements Analysis (tag name `4.1-analyzed`)
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Re-write the instructions in your own words.
    *   If you don't do this, you won't know what you're supposed to do!
    *   Don't leave out details!
*   [ ] Explain the problem this program aims to solve.
    *   Describe what a *good* solution looks like.
    *   List what you already know how to do.
    *   Point out any challenges that you can foresee.
*   [ ] List all of the data that is used by the program, making note of where it comes from.
    *   Explain what form the output will take.
*   [ ] List the algorithms that will be used (but don't write them yet).
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-analyzed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

* The Goal of this assignment is to change the fractal-painter program into an object oriented program such that it will be able to easily implement new fractals, and will be more easily updateable. 
* To have a *good* solution to this problem, it will need to follow good organizational patterns of object oriented programming, not implement anything that overcomplecates anything, assume nothing about file locations, create new-well organized-classes and modules. 
* The biggest challenge I forsee is creating the pallete class because reading the Requirements.md file made it clear that there are some things about it that I do not know how to do, I'll probably have to have chatGPT explain the concepts to me after I do some research into it. 
* The Data used by the program is a large list of fractal configurations contained in the data/ folder. They will be accessed by a method that I will write called fractalConfig(?) which will take the data and store it in a dictionary for the two factory classes to use. 
* The output, like the last assignment, will be in the form of a tkinter window of the image of the fractal. 

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

### Pallete Class:
    I used chat GPT to teach me about the Colour module and had it help me conceptualize the two designs. After I get the other ones done This will undoubtably not be the final design. 
    ```
    class Pallete
        def init()
            -- do something --
        def getColor()
            raise NotImplementedError("Concrete subclass of Palette must implement getColor() method")  # copied from 4.1 Requirements
    
    class StripedPalette(Palette):
        def getColor(self, n):
            # Create a color palette with repeating stripes
            colors = ['#FF0000', '#00FF00', '#0000FF']
            return colors[n % len(colors)]

    class GradientPalette(Palette):
        def __init__(self, start_color, end_color):
            super().__init__()
            self.start_color = Color(start_color)
            self.end_color = Color(end_color)

        def getColor(self, n)
            # Create a color palette using a gradient between start and end colors
            interpolation = n / 512.0  # Adjust for the desired number of iterations
            color = self.start_color.range_to(self.end_color, interpolation)
            return color.get_hex_l()

    class DynamicPalette(Palette)
        def __init__(self, start_color, end_color)
            super().init()
            self.start_color = Color(start_color)
            self.end_color = Color(end_color)

        def getColor(self, n)
            # Create a dynamically generated color palette using the colour module
            interpolation = n / 512.0
            color = self.start_color.range_to(self.end_color, interpolation)
            return color.get_hex_l()
    ```

### Palette Factory
```
import Palette 

class PaletteFactory:
    def makePalette(palette_name, fractal_info is dynamic by default) 
        Palette_Options = Palette()

        if palette_name == "striped"
            return Palette_options.StripedPalette()
        elif palette_name == "gradient":
            return Palette_options.GradientPalette("#FF0000", "#0000FF")
        elif palette_name == "dynamic":
            return Palette_options.DynamicPalette("#FF0000", "#00FF00")
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("Invalid palette requested")
```

### Image painter
This one is the easiest one because it only needs to be put into a class. There are some other requirements but we can cross that bridge when we get there. 

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.1-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
